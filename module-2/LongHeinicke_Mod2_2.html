        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <p class="intro">
           I grew up in Iowa. Not any of the small town ideals that might be associated with it, but in Council Bluffs. And there is not a day I am not thankful that my parents moved my family away from it. 
            <span class="sentence">Though the rest of my family remains along the Iowa, Nebraska boarder, I am more than happy to be in Kansas.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure, I was upset that I could not spend time with my cousins like before, but the friends I made down here outweighed any lingering longing for the North. After all, this was a chance to start over and be who I wanted to without anyone knowing me from before. So I became an Art Kid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Theater? Yup, I did that. Art classes? You betcha. And I won KC metro awards for it. Volunteered for the big mural project at the school? Again, of course I would do that as well as be a teacher’s aide to the art teacher. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So now comes the time to consider why I didn’t pursue a career in the arts. The simple answer is that it comes down to time. There are no unions for most art careers, especially in game design where I got my associates degree. Most jobs would have you move out to California for $60k a year and have you working 80+ hours a week. So it was time to find something where I could have a work life balance.
