        <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>

        <p>
            Two roads diverged in a <span id="span1">_____</span> wood,  
            And sorry I could not travel both  
            And be one <span id="span2">_____</span>, long I stood  
            And looked down one as far as I could  
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
            <button onclick="fillInWord('span1', word1)">Reveal</button>
            <button onclick="fillInWord('span2', word2)">Reveal</button>
        </p>

        <p>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,  
            And having perhaps the better claim,  
            Because it was <span id="span3">_____</span> and wanted wear;  
            Though as for that the passing there  
            Had worn them really about the same,  
            <button onclick="fillInWord('span3', word3)">Reveal</button>
        </p>

        <p>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh  
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”  
            I took the one less traveled by,  
            And that has made all the <span id="span4">_____</span>.  
            <button onclick="fillInWord('span4', word4)">Reveal</button>
        </p>
